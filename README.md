### Links

- Live Site URL: [Add live site URL here](https://your-live-site-url.com)

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Figtree](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Figtree) (Font Family)
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

In this project, I learned how to:

- Effectively use CSS custom properties for color and layout consistency.
- Implement Flexbox and CSS Grid for a responsive and adaptable layout.
- Design with a mobile-first approach, ensuring responsiveness from small to large screen sizes.
- Enhance the user experience by adding interactive hover and focus states to clickable elements.

### Continued development

In future projects, I aim to focus on:

- **JavaScript integration**: Adding interactivity such as dynamic content, animations, or even creating a blog-like functionality (e.g., a comment section or like/dislike buttons) will help enhance my skills.
- **Accessibility**: Ensuring that the page is fully accessible, including testing with screen readers and making the design keyboard-navigable, to meet WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) standards.
- **Performance optimization**: Learning techniques for reducing page load times, such as optimizing images and using lazy loading for resources, is an area I want to explore further.
- **Advanced CSS features**: I want to dive deeper into CSS Grid, CSS Variables, and CSS animations to add more complex layouts and fluid design systems in future projects.

### Useful resources

- [CSS Tricks Flexbox Guide](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - This guide was incredibly helpful in understanding how to create layouts using Flexbox. It made it much easier to center elements and control their alignment.
- [MDN Web Docs: CSS Grid](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout) - I used this resource to understand how to implement CSS Grid for better layout control. It helped me create a clean, organized, and responsive design.
- [Google Fonts: Figtree](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Figtree) - This font was a great choice for the design, and Google Fonts made it super easy to integrate with just a single line of code.
- [Frontend Mentor's Design Resources](https://www.frontendmentor.io/resources) - The resources provided by Frontend Mentor helped guide my approach to making the project more professional and polished.
